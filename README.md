# cs50x-Finance

This is my take on **C$50x - Finance (pset9)** - [requirements here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/9/finance/)

The task is to implement a fully functional website in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for users to "buy" and "sell" stocks in a virtual trading environment.

You get to put to use a lot of the knowledge that you gain by going trough the course.

Python, HTML, CSS, SQL and Jinja templates are glued together in a fully-functional web application - it was the first real challenge in cs50x for me.
